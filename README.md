# Rurik-Ironheart

**Overview**  
Rurik-Ironheart is my very first front-end development project. The site is built as both a **learning exercise** and a **tribute to my Dungeons & Dragons character, Rurik**. Through this project, I’m practicing **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, experimenting with layout, interactivity, and responsive design from the ground up.

## Purpose & Goals

- **Learning by Doing:** Gain hands-on experience with front-end fundamentals.
- **Creative Expression:** Bring my D&D character, Rurik, to life in a digital format.
- **Skill Growth:** Strengthen my ability to structure clean, maintainable code and explore modern best practices.

## Repository Structure

```

Rurik-Ironheart/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── spells.html         # Supplementary page: showcases Rurik’s spells
├── styles.css          # Project styling
├── script.js           # Core JavaScript
└── README.md           # Project documentation

```

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repo**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/MatanKarmazin/Rurik-Ironheart.git`

2. **Navigate into the directory**:  
   `cd Rurik-Ironheart`

3. **Open in a browser**:  
   Just open `index.html`—no build tools required.

## Current & Planned Features

- **Responsive Layout** so it works on desktop and mobile.  
- **Character Showcase** to present Rurik’s story and background.  
- **Interactive Elements** with JavaScript (buttons, menus, or animations).  
- **Thematic Styling** to reflect the fantasy/D&D atmosphere.  

## Development Notes

- This is a **first-time project**, so the focus is on **learning and experimenting**—not perfection.  
- HTML, CSS, and JS are kept **modular and simple** to maximize clarity.  
- Each feature is an opportunity to try out **new patterns and techniques**.  

## Future Plans

- Add more interactivity (modal windows, dynamic content).  
- Experiment with animations and transitions.  
- Explore accessibility and responsive best practices.  
- Potentially expand into a **full character site** with story, stats, and artwork.
